# Time Planner Deluxe
A Personal Information Manager written for Windows 3.1

#### History
In 1991, Apple was intolerably arrogant, IBM dazed and confused, and Linus still in college. Windows 3.0 came as a breath of fresh air; a good enough GUI for the rest of us that ran just fine on a computer we could afford. Charles Petzold wrote the indispensable one-volume explanation for developers; Borland introduced a very respectable C++ compiler. Windows 3.1, released in 1992, raised the ante. Every red-blooded programmer quit his day job and became an entrepreneur.

Personal Information Managers had a short run as a hot category around this time. Time Planner Deluxe was my entry, a hybrid between a lightweight project management system and a personal calendar. It offered the usual calendar functions plus integrated drag-and-drop Gantt charts with time and rate calculations.

Jeff Goldberg and I wrote Time Planner Deluxe, releasing version 1.0 sometime in 1992. We got lucky: it was licensed and relabeled by SoftKey as "Key Project Manager" and also bundled with Microsoft Office in a huge government contract.

Looking at this with hindsight, I see a classic design mistake: we larded it up with way too many features and didn't pay enough attention to the core use case. For something that was meant to be "personal" it just didn't flow well enough. These days I use OneNote; I think that's in spirit what I was aiming for.

#### Tech Notes
This is a 16-bit Windows program, originally for Windows 3.1. It works fine on modern 32-bit versions of Windows, including the 32-bit version of Windows 10, but not on 64-bit versions.

Tidbit: it supports Windows for Pen Computing.  You can, if you can get ahold of mid-nineties tablet hardware, use a stylus to capture handwritten notes.

Compiled with Borland C++ and OWL 1.0.
